# Generalized linear models




# Linear models versus generalized linear models

The main purpose of this tutorial is to show how to user GLMs in R, so we'll keep the mathematics to a minimum, but a basic understanding of maximum likelihood is usefull for understanding how GLMs work, and why certain elements require different interpretation compared to plain linear regression.
